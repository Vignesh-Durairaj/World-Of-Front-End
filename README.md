# World Of Front End
Let this space acts as a placeholder for my hands-on practices with the polished front end technologies of the latest generation

* Started out with some practices in `HTML5`
  * usage of Canvas and a brick-breaker game based on this.
  * testing out new elements in `HTML5` that are used in documents/forms like *Articles* and *Apart*.
